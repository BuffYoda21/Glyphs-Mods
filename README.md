# Glyphs-Mods
Random mods I made for Glyphs

This is a collection of temporary mods I made for Glyphs by VortexBros while building up my skills to make more complicated mods. I just thought I might share them.

Check out the game at:
Itch.io: https://vortex-bros.itch.io/glyphs  
Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3616230/GLYPHS/

# Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader at https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0 I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click "Add Game Manually", then navigate to your Glyphs executable.
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your mod.dll into the Mods folder.
4) Run the game.

# Notes
It is VERY important to pay attention to the number in the name of the mod you are using. Mods with a 6 are to be used with v1.6 of Glyphs and mods with a 7 are to be used with v1.7 of Glyphs (steam release). This is primarily because of the way the game is compiled in version 1.7.

# Credits
I did not make MelonLoader, I am just a guy who made mods that run on their program. Any and all credit for MelonLoader goes to the creators of MelonLoader.

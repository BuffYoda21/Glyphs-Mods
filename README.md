# Glyphs-Mods
Random mods I made for Glyphs

This is a collection of mods I made for Glyphs by VortexBros. Every mod has it's own description file you can read to understand what it does.

Check out the game at:  
Itch.io: https://vortex-bros.itch.io/glyphs  
Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3616230/GLYPHS/

# Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader at https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0 I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click "Add Game Manually", then navigate to your Glyphs executable.
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your mod.dll into the Mods folder (make sure you download the correct version of the mod for your game version!).
4) Run the game.

# Credits
I did not make MelonLoader, I am just a guy who made mods that run on their program. Any and all credit for MelonLoader goes to the creators of MelonLoader.

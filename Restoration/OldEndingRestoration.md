# Old Ending Restoration (WIP)
This mod restores the original ending of Glyphs by making the area accessable and fixing various triggers and other miscelanious things that break.

This mod is not finished yet. As of now the only thing it does is re-enable the region. It is still completely inaccessable to normal gameplay but you can use tools like UnityExplorer to teleport there (It is placed in the bottom right corner of the map). There are also still issues with the camera in one specific area and the final boss's hitbox. All of this will be fixed in the future though.

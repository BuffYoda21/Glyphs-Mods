# Old Ending Restoration (WIP)
Compatable with Glyphs v1.2-v1.6  
Partially compatible with Glyphs v1.7 (You will encounter bugs. See dedicated repo for more details)

This mod restores the original ending of Glyphs by making the area accessable and fixing various triggers and other miscelanious things that break.

This mod is not finished yet. As of now the only thing it does is re-enable the region and fix some logic that breaks the camera. It is still completely inaccessable to normal gameplay but you can use tools like UnityExplorer to teleport there (It is placed in the bottom right corner of the map). There are also still issues the final boss's hitbox. All of this will be fixed in the future though.

# Infinte Stun Mod (Late Game Spoilers)
This mod makes the monster in the outer void permanetly stuck where he spawns and he can no longer harm you.

This is not intented to be practical as it makes the area (nearly) impossible to complete (you can use a glitch that lets you wall jump to get one of the orbs) but rather it is supposed to be a proof of concept mod (and a bit funny).
